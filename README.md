# True Type Font Renderer

This project is a TrueType font renderer written in Swift.

In simple terms, a font renderer is the part of a system that reads the information in a font file and draws the characters so you can see them. It translates the design of the letters into pixels on your screen or shapes in your graphics.

This specific project focuses on the TrueType font format (.ttf files). It provides the Swift code needed to load these TrueType files and process their data to display text.
